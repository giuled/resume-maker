		Is making a resume hard, time consuming, or you just don't know how to do it?  Then this is the website for you!  It's not only easy to use, but it does most of the work for you.  The only thing that you have to do is type in the information that it prompts you for and then it will display multiple different formats, and explain what each one is used for. From there just pick your favorite one and it will get emailed to you so it can be either emailed to every where you want to apply to or so you can print it off and bring copies in with you.
